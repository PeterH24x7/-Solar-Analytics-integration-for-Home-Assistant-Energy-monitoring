SOLAR ANALYTICS integration for Home Assistant Energy Monitoring

Installation Instructions:
#
#   1. Copy the solar_analytics.yaml file to the HA config directory.
#
#   2. Include this file name as a package in the HA configuration.yaml. 
#      For example -
#        packages:
#          pack_1: !include solar_analytics.yaml
#
#   3. Define sa_username, sa_password and sa_site_id (e.g. 36304) in the secrets.yaml file.
#
#   4. After first run, review the attributes sa_data_by_5min to identify the 
#      device specific channel names and update the sa_todays_... xyz sensor to suit.
#
#   6. Add the new energy sensors from 4. above to the HA Energy Manager as "Monitor 
#      Individual Devices". Go to HA settings and then search for “Energy Configuration” 
#      to make the changes.
#
#   7. Also in HA Energy Configuration, enter the details for
#      > Grid consumption - as sa_todays_energy_imported
#      > Return to grid - as sa_todays_energy_exported
#      > Solar production - as sa_todays_energy_generated_total
#
#   8. If all working is correctly, the Energy dashboard should start populating data within 
#      a couple of hours.
