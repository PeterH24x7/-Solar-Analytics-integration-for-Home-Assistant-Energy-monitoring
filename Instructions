SOLAR ANALYTICS integration for Home Assistant Energy Monitoring

Installation Instructions:

#   1. Copy this yaml file to the HA config directory.
#   2. Include this file name as a package in the HA configuration.yaml. 
#      For example -
#        packages:
#          pack_1: !include solar_analytics.yaml
#   3. Define sa_username, sa_password and sa_site_id (e.g. 36304) in the secrets.yaml file.
#   4. Using developer tools check configuration and restart.  From States, review the 
#      attributes for sa_data_by_5min to identify the device specific channel names and 
#      update/delete the sa_todays_... xyz sensors to suit.
#   6. Add the new energy sensors from 4. above to the HA Energy Manager as "Monitor 
#      Individual Devices". Go to HA settings and then search for “Energy Configuration” 
#      to make the changes.
#   7. Also in HA Energy Configuration, enter the details for
#      > Grid consumption - as sa_todays_energy_imported
#      > Return to grid - as sa_todays_energy_exported
#      > Solar production - as sa_todays_energy_generated_total
#   8. If all working is correctly, the Energy dashboard should start populating data within 
#      a couple of hours.
#   9. If HA EM "Grid Consumption" and "Return to grid" are configured with energy pricing 
#      details, then the net cost, import rate and export rate should work without further
#      config. Else delete these sensors.
#   10.Enjoy!
