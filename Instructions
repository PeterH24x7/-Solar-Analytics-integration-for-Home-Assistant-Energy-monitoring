SOLAR ANALYTICS integration for Home Assistant Energy Monitoring

Installation Instructions:

1. Cut/past the YAML code below into the “sensor:” section of your HA configuration.yaml file.

2. Edit your secrets.yaml file to include your Solar Analytics account username and password as sa_username and sa_password. 
  You will also add a site_id which is available from your Solar Analytics account portal - looking something like "36305". 

  For example:
    sa_username: "fred.nerks@acme.com"
    sa_password: "secret1"
    sa_site_id:  "12345"

3. Validate the configuration.yaml, and then restart HA.

4. On first run there won’t be any data if you haven't configured a site id - look in the sa_site_list attributes for your site_id.

5. Add your sa_site_id (replace for 12345 above) in the secrets.yaml file.

6. Again validate the configuration.yaml, and then restart HA and the data gets should now be working.

7. In the HA Configuration > Energy page enter the details for
    > Grid consumption - as sa_todays_energy_imported
    > Return to grid - as sa_todays_energy_exported
    > Solar production - as sa_todays_energy_generated_total
    
8. If all working correctly, the Energy dashboard should start populating data within a couple of hours.
