SOLAR ANALYTICS integration for Home Assistant Energy Monitoring

This code is provided as-is and without any warrantee or guarantees. 
Further public contributions and enhancements are welcomed.
 
INSTALLATION - NEW: 
#   1. Copy this yaml file to the Home Assistant (HA) config folder.
#   2. Include this file name as a package in the HA configuration.yaml. 
#      For example -
#        packages:
#          pack_1: !include solar_analytics.yaml
#   3. Define sa_username, sa_password and sa_site_id (e.g. 36304) in the secrets.yaml file (see
#      example on github).
#   4. Using HA Developer Tools check the configuration and restart.   
#   5. Go to HA Settings and then search for “Energy Configuration” to make the changes to the Energy 
#      Dashboard Configuration. #nter the details for:
#      > Grid consumption - as sa_todays_energy_imported
#      > Return to grid - as sa_todays_energy_exported
#      > Solar production - as sa_todays_energy_generated_total
#   6. Add the energy load sensors to the HA Energy Dashboard as "Monitor Individual Devices".
#   7. If all is working is correctly, the Energy Dashboard should start populating data within 
#      a couple of hours.
#   8. If the HA Dashboard "Grid Consumption" and "Return to grid" are configured with energy unit pricing 
#      details, then the sa_todays_energy_imported_cost and sa_todays_energy_exported_compensation sensors 
#      will be auto-created by the Energy Dashboard. These sensors can be found as hidden Entities 
#      (which can't be changed or deleted). If all good, then the sa_todays_energy_import_rate 
#      (daily av. $/kWh), sa_todays_energy_export_rate (daily av. $/kWh) and
#      sa_todays_energy_total_net_cost ($) should work without further config. If no pricing 
#      is set, then optionally delete these 3x sensors from the configuration.
#   9. Enjoy!

UPGRADING - FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION:
#   This upgrade should not break the sensors created in a previous versions. It's recommended that the 
#   previous version solar_analytics.yaml should be deleted/renamed, HA restarted, the new solar_analytics.yaml
#   copied to the <config> folder and then HA restarted again. The sensors should start repopulating
#   within their refresh timecycles. If any duplicate sensors happen to be created, go to HA Settings ->
#   Devices & Services -> Entities and delete any "sa_..." prefixed sensors showing as unavailable or
#   disabled, then restart once more and the correctly named sensor and its data should be restored
#   to normal. Alternatively go to 'Developer Tools -> Services' and select 'Recorder: Purge Entities' 
#   and then 'Choose entity' and select all the "sa_..." entities needing to purge immediately.
