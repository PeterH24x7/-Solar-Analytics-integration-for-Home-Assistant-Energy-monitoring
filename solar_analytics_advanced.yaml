# Last updated: 13-Dec-25 as Release 10 DRAFT - see update notes below.
#
# Updates: 
#     16-Jan-2022 - INITIAL RELEASE 1
#                 - Added power reporting (last 5 minute average).
#     16-Jul-2022 - RELEASE 2
#                 - Enabled more accurate and more frequent 1 minute power reporting
#                 - Added 5 minute energy updates for all channels
#                 - Moved sa_site_id to secrets.yaml.
#     20-Aug-2022 - RELEASE 3
#                 - Added some error checking to deal with daily energy total errors when the 
#                   data get is 'unavailable' or 'unknown'
#                 - Removed "force_update: true" - where the data get may be 'unavailable'
#                 - Removed "state_class: measurement" and "device_class: energy" for rest platform 
#                   sensors (not applicable)
#     10-Feb-2023 - RELEASE 4
#                 - Added "unique_id" to each sensor entity (including existing) to enable HA 
#                   Lovelace based settings changes.
#                 - Added new "Total Energy Generated Expected" sensor to provide daily cumulative 
#                   expected energy (as per the Solar Analytics portal).
#                 - Added kW sensors as conversions of their respective W counterpart (note: not 
#                   required for energy entities as of HA 2023.2).
#                 - Where HA EM is used for cost calculations added "Todays Energy Total Net Cost" 
#                   (import cost minus feed-in revenue).
#                 - For those on variable energy rates (e.g. Amber) created new sensors "Todays Energy 
#                   Import Rate" and "Todays Energy Export Rate".
#     10-Apr-2023 - RELEASE 5
#                 - Added "unique_id" to each REST sensor.
#                 - Implemented token authentication with timer based refresh using username/password.
#                 - Updated REST sensors to use token authentication.
#                 - Changed sa_live_site_data to 60s scan_interval (avoid repeated update at 30s 
#                   interval where data actually only changes every minute - some users may consider 
#                   changing back to 30s to reduce the delay to update).
#                 - Added time_stamp attribute to sa_todays_energy_total_net_cost, 
#                   sa_todays_energy_import_rate and sa_todays_energy_export_rate.
#                 - Added 3x new sensors sa_todays_energy_consumed_solar (Wh), 
#                   sa_todays_generated_consumed_percentage (%) and 
#                   sa_todays_consumed_generated_percentage (%).
#                 - Added automation sa_refresh_all_rest_gets to manually force refesh of all REST 
#                   data gets.
#                 - Added sa_todays_electric_vehicle_generated and sa_todays_electric_vehicle_imported as
#                   breakdown of the daily EV charging energy into generated and imported sourced energy.
#                   Does not include EV charger standby energy and the sum of these sensors may differ
#                   slightly from sa_todays_electric_vehicle_total. Attributes include last 5 minute
#                   energy and % of total.
#                 - Modified all REST gets from template platform rest to RESTful sensors. Required to 
#                   solve overflowing attributes.data for sa_data_by_5min. Also resolves many of the
#                   sensor unit issues (ie. Wh/kWh and W/kW).
#                 - Added Energy history sensor for graphing each SA channel (e.g. in Apex Charts).
#                   Note: results are 5 minute average power (kW), with area under the graph being the energy
#                   usage within that time interval. The time duration is limited to 28x 5 minute intervals
#                   (= 2h20m) as this fits within the 255 character max allowed by the state of a sensor.
#                   Rounding to a reduced number of decimal places (e.g. 1 instead of 2) could increase
#                   the number of intervals if that's desireable, but at a lower resolution.
#       24-Aug-23 - RELEASE 6.2 - MINOR FIXES, IMPROVED ERROR CHECKING AND CODE TIDY-UP
#                 - sa_data_by_5min_meter_reset is depracated as not used/required (separate Amber code
#                   has own midnight meter trigger). Uncomment if still required.
#                 - sa_data_by_5min_exported_total and sa_data_by_5min_consumed_solar_total added error
#                   and generated negative value testing.
#                 - sa_data_by_5min_load_ev_charger_generated and sa_data_by_5min_load_ev_charger_imported
#                   corrected calculation - minor missing logic.
#                 - sa_data_by_5min_history_time_stamp_count added time_stamp attribute.
#                 - sa_todays_electric_vehicle_generated and sa_todays_electric_vehicle_imported corrected
#                   calculations for ev_energy_last5min attribute.
#                 - sa_todays_generated_consumed_percentage and sa_todays_consumed_generated_percentage
#                   fixed calculation logic where total energy generated at start of the day
#                   could be negative (i.e. the inverter has consumed energy at start-up).
#                 - general improved error checking using is_number (instead of is defined) and providing
#                   float(0.0) and int(0) default values.
#                 - added comment markers for begin/end code to be deleted for 3-phase implementation.
#                 - general code tidy-up, layout consistency and readability improvements.
#       31-Aug-23 - RELEASE 6.3 - MINOR FIXES for anomalous data gets.
#                 - Enhanced data checking for sa_data_by_5min... REST get related sensors where the data's 
#                   first entry [0] was strangely found to contain 'null' data, but subsequent data [1]+ 
#                   all okay.
#       7-Feb-24  - RELEASE 7
#                 - Address SA data get anomoly where first record [0] contains 'null' data for 
#                   energy_generated, energy_consumed etc.
#                 - Added new sensor sa_status_log_entry that gets the site fault status (if not okay). 
#                   Fault related details are in the sensor attributes.
#       12-Oct-24 - RELEASE 8--
#                 - Updated code comments as applicable. Deleted old dated commentary.
#                 - Fixes to improve error checking for value_json.data and unexpected null values.
#                   Refer Github issue "Periods of offline aren't handled well in the 5min sensors" raised 
#                   by aaronpowell on 27-Sep-24.
#                 - Added 3x automation triggers sa_data_by_5min_trigger, sa_live_site_data_trigger,
#                   sa_data_by_hour_trigger to optimise the timing of the respective data gets which
#                   otherwise start arbitrarily on restart/reload. To avoid mini get-storms resulting
#                   from this code, the gets are distributed at appropriate intervals.
#                 - Updated site_status get with extra attributes (per @aaronpowell).
#       10-Feb-25 - RELEASE 9 - MINOR ADDITION TO HISTORY SENSOR ONLY.
#                 - Added new history sensor - sa_data_by_5min_history_imported_exported. Included as
#                   new attribute in sa_todays_energy_history.
#                 - Modified sa_data_by_5min_history_energy_generated to only include +ve values.
#                 - Minor code redo to align with solar_analytics_battery.yaml functioning.
#                 - Added last5min energy attribute to sa_todays_xloadx_total and 
#                   sa_todays_energy_imported/exported sensors. Units are Wh.
#       13-Dec-25 - Changes meet modern template sensor format (old format to be deprecated 30-Jun-26).
#                 - Basic code tidy-up deleting redundant/old commentary.
#                 - Fixed minor system log errors associated w/ sa_todays_..._percentage related sensors.
#
# This code is provided as-is and without any warrantee or guarantees. 
# Further public contributions and enhancements are welcomed.
# 
# INSTALLATION - NEW: 
#   1. Copy this yaml file to the Home Assistant (HA) config folder.
#   2. Include this file name as a package in the HA configuration.yaml. 
#      For example -
#        packages:
#          pack_1: !include solar_analytics.yaml
#   3. Define sa_username, sa_password and sa_site_id (e.g. 36304) in the secrets.yaml file (see
#      example on github).
#   4. Using HA Developer Tools check the configuration and restart.   
#   5. Go to HA Settings and then search for “Energy Configuration” to make the changes to the Energy 
#      Dashboard Configuration. #nter the details for:
#      > Grid consumption - as sa_todays_energy_imported
#      > Return to grid - as sa_todays_energy_exported
#      > Solar production - as sa_todays_energy_generated_total
#   6. Add the energy load sensors to the HA Energy Dashboard as "Monitor Individual Devices".
#   7. If all is working is correctly, the Energy Dashboard should start populating data within 
#      a couple of hours.
#   8. If the HA Dashboard "Grid Consumption" and "Return to grid" are configured with energy unit pricing 
#      details, then the sa_todays_energy_imported_cost and sa_todays_energy_exported_compensation sensors 
#      will be auto-created by the Energy Dashboard. These sensors can be found as hidden Entities 
#      (which can't be changed or deleted). If all good, then the sa_todays_energy_import_rate 
#      (daily av. $/kWh), sa_todays_energy_export_rate (daily av. $/kWh) and
#      sa_todays_energy_total_net_cost ($) should work without further config. If no pricing 
#      is set, then optionally delete these 3x sensors from the configuration.
#   9. Enjoy!
#
# UPGRADING - FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION:
#   This upgrade should not break the sensors created in a previous versions. It's recommended that the 
#   previous version solar_analytics.yaml should be deleted/renamed, HA restarted, the new solar_analytics.yaml
#   copied to the <config> folder and then HA restarted again. The sensors should start repopulating
#   within their refresh timecycles. If any duplicate sensors happen to be created, go to HA Settings ->
#   Devices & Services -> Entities and delete any "sa_..." prefixed sensors showing as unavailable or
#   disabled, then restart once more and the correctly named sensor and its data should be restored
#   to normal. Alternatively go to 'Developer Tools -> Actions' and select 'Purge entities, 
#   recorder purge.entities' and then 'entity_id' and then enter a list of entities needing to be purged.
